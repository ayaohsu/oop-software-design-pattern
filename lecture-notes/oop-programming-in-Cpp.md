## Chapter 1. The big picture
- _Structured Programming_: functions and modules (a group of components that execute lists of instructions)
- problems with structured programming:
  1. functions have unrestricted access to global data
  2. does a poor job of modeling things in the real world
- Reusability: by adding additional features to an existing class with inheritance (vs wrapping up an existing class)
  - Inheritance: 'adding' APIs, to extend/customize it
  - Wrapper: 'modifying/reducing' APIs, to make something general to be customized to our need (we need a term here _specification_)
